## Inspiration

Mental health is often overlooked in patients with muscular dystrophy, despite the profound effects their condition can have on emotional well-being. We noticed the lack of tools to help individuals track and understand their emotions in a way that supports their mental health journey. We wanted to create a solution that could provide valuable insights into emotional trends and help users identify where they feel their strongest emotions.

## What It Does

MO:NT is an interactive mobile app designed to improve mental health for muscular dystrophy patients by allowing them to track their emotions based on location. Users are notified to track how they feel in different locations  as they visit various places.

MO:NT then generates an interactive emotional map, showing users where they feel their best and worst. Additionally, the app provides AI-generated insights based on emotional trends, offering recommendations on where to go for a mood boost or to avoid stress triggers.

**Features include:**
- Emotional tracking based on location
- Interactive map highlighting emotional hotspots
- AI-driven feedback on recent emotional trends and suggestions for improving mental well-being

## How We Built It

We used Expo and React Native for the mobile app's frontend, enabling cross-platform support. On the backend, we used Supabase to manage the database and authentication. The interactive emotional map was displayed using Google Maps API, while OpenAI was used to generate insights by identifying patterns in emotional entries.

## What's Next for MO:NT

Our next steps for MO:NT involve expanding our emotional trend analysis by incorporating more advanced AI models to improve the accuracy of insights. We also aim to include features that allow users to share their emotional maps with healthcare providers, helping to bridge the gap between mental health and medical treatment. In the future, we plan to integrate MO:NT with wearable devices, offering more precise tracking of emotional states and their correlation with physical health data.
